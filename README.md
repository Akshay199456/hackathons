## Hackathon #1: 2016.12.17 @ Noisebridge

Projects list:

### Snowflake

**Description**: Tor pluggable transport for helping Tor users get
around censorship of Tor (yes, Tor!)

**Tech**: Go

**Getting Started URL**: https://github.com/keroserene/snowflake/issues/36

**Project URL**: https://github.com/keroserene/snowflake


### Tor Metrics

**Description**: "The primary place to learn interesting facts about
the Tor network, the largest deployed anonymity network to date. If
something can be measured safely, you'll find it here.

**Tech**: Tech knowledge required: Java, maybe SQL

**Motivation**: "Tor metrics are the ammunition that lets Tor and
other security advocates argue for a more private and secure Internet
from a position of data, rather than just dogma or perspective." -
Bruce Schneier (June 1, 2016)

**Getting Started URL**: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/MetricsTeam/Volunteers

**Project URL**: https://metrics.torproject.org/ and https://collector.torproject.org/

**Code**: https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-web.git


### OnionShare

**Description**: OnionShare "lets you securely and anonymously share a
file of any size" over Tor.

**Tech**: Python

**Getting Started URL**: https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

**Project URL**: https://onionshare.org/

**Code**: https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare


### Mission Improbable

**Description**: Secure Android-based OS that starts with CopperheadOS
and adds tighter Tor integration, and adds the Play Store so that
Signal and other secure apps can be installed.

**Tech**: Bash and a little Python

**Getting Started**: Talk to Mike Perry!

**Project URL**: https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/mission-improbable


### Secure audio/video recording app for journalists/activists

**Description/Motivation**: Activists want to record police
interactions then encrypt and upload the video footage to a safe
location. Also, journalists want to record sensitive interviews and
testimony, then record that audio with a public key so that even if
their device is seized, whoever stole their phone can't get the audio,
thereby keeping their sources safe.

**Tech**: CameraV video recording tech: Java. Audio recording tech:
whatever you want to use!

**Getting Started URL**:

- CameraV: https://github.com/guardianproject/camerav/wiki#how-can-i-contribute

More info:

> One core component of CameraV is our encrypted photo and video camera,
which is a separate simpler project called CameraCipher:
https://github.com/n8fr8/CameraCipher
>
> CameraCipher might be the best place to get started, without all of the
other functionality of CameraV. There are many things to do to improve
CameraCipher, both on the UI and usability front (make a better, pretty,
easier to use Camera UI) and the encrypted media front (streaming video
frames and audio in sync to an encrypted storage volume is hard!).

- New app: https://github.com/cpunkswritecode/projects/tree/master/project-ideas/encrypted-footage-recording#idea-encrypted--replicated-video--audio-recording-app

For the new app, talk to Kiara (iOS dev) and Ellen (UXer)!

**Project URLs**:

- CameraV: https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav/

- New app: https://github.com/cpunkswritecode/projects/tree/master/project-ideas/encrypted-footage-recording


### CryptoBot

**Description**: A bot to practice sending PGP-encrypted emails to
that gives you feedback on how to make those messages more secure.

**Tech**: Python

**Getting Started URL**: TODO

**Project URL**: https://github.com/EFForg/cryptobot-email


### Absence Alert

**Description/Motivation**: Absence Alert is a FLOSS tool that will
help vulnerable populations and activists get the word out to their
friends and family in case they are arrested or detained.  When you
sign up for an account, you enter a message to be sent to a list of
email addresses.  From that moment forward, you'll have to continually
(say, daily) disable that alert from being sent.

**Tech**: Rails, Bootstrap

**Getting Started**: Talk to Bill!

**Project URL**: https://github.com/Hainish/absence-alert


### CrypTag Notes

**Description**: End-to-end encrypted note-taking and shared wiki page
app for Windows, Mac, and Linux desktops.  Built on
[CrypTag](https://github.com/cryptag/cryptag), so it can use just
about anything as the server -- Dropbox, a local folder, Sandstorm,
your own server, etc.

**Tech**: JavaScript (React.js), Bootstrap, Electron

**Getting Started URL**: https://github.com/cryptag/notes/issues + Talk to Steve!

**Project URL**: https://github.com/cryptag/notes


### SecureDrop

**Description**: SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission
system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents
from and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created
by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by Freedom of the
Press Foundation.

**Tech**: Python

**Getting Started URL**: https://github.com/cpunkswritecode/projects/issues/1#issuecomment-260164089 +
Talk to the many SecureDrop people we have here (toward the front of the room)!

**Project URL**: https://securedrop.org/
